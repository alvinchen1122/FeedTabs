# How to Build and Run without errors

First, open a terminal and cd into the folder that was downloaded. Run command 'ls' to make sure all the files that were in the folder show up. 
Second, run command 'pod install'. Afterwards, open the app in FeedTabs.xcworkspace only.
Third, build and run the app. You may notice three errors: two will be in file LongPressReorder. **Click fix if they have the option too**. If not, then ignore it. The third error will most likely be that 'Firebase module not found'. This can also be ignored.

After these fixes, build and run again and the app should run.
